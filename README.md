# Blockchain on Emergencies like accidents

# Use solidity and deploy on polygon testnet and Sepolia testnet

## This story of the project is given below:
In emergencies, in most cases, patients donâ€™t get an ambulance at the exact time.  Here, we can use Blockchain to track not only ambulances but also patients. The idea is to track ambulances, real-time patient data sharing, and groundbreaking communication protocols between emergency services and healthcare facilities.

*We add some functions to tract these.
* There are Registration functions for patients and ambulance providers.
* There is a function which share the patients' data to the hospital in a secure channel.
